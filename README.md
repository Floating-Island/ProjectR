# ProjectR
Final Project for the Engineer's Degree

A Futuristic 3D Racing Game to insert myself into the videogame industry.

Here you'll find my own implementation of a Continuous Integration environment for Unreal Engine 4, that's triggered by GitHub Push and Pull Requests notifying a Jenkins pipeline. Jenkins then builds the project, runs all the project's tests and notifies the result of the job to the user via Slack.

I learned to utilize the Unreal Automation Framework to create my own C++ tests (~340 tests), ranging from:
- Simple testing of class object attributes.
- Actor tests within a world (accelerating jets, testing anti-gravity, lap behaviour, race rules, controller interaction and so on).
- UI tests (clicking menu buttons).
- Simple replication (replication automating a networked PIE session with a server and a client).

This also has the project's logical view and my thesis (in Spanish, sorry).

I hope every player that plays it and programmer that reads it will enjoy it as much as I did while making it and playing with it :)
